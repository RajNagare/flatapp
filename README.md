The web app kickstarter

# TL;DR
Prototyping web apps sucks & needed to roll out web 
apps like a boss.

# So whats the big deal?

- PHP driven (as in the easiest way possible)
- Templated with Twig
- All  the whiz-bang js + css libs out there 
like bootstrap and modernizr

# Install Gus

- Get source
- Update $config['app_root'] values to match your 
server's absolute path for the application application
- Make sure that templates/cache/ is writeable by apache (or the like)
- Rage n3wbs

# Requirements

- PHP 5.2.4 + (Twig)
